<p>The baserom uses a framework of custom objects to allow you to toggle or activate some simple UberASM codes that are in the baserom, most of which are very basic utility features or simple state changes. They are activated simply by inserting a custom extended object into whichever levels you want with no limit. These objects work alongside any level UberASM you may want to use as well.</p>

<h3 id="available-objects">Available Objects</h3>
<p>The tables below detail the objects available in the baserom and what their purpose is. Each object has a unique ID number that corresponds to its "extended object" value that is to be used when <a href="#inserting-objects">inserting</a> it as a Custom Object in Lunar Magic. Simply make note of the ID(s) of object(s) you would like you use and insert them in your level manually.</p>
<h4 id="feature-toggles">Feature Toggles</h4>
<p>The following objects can be used to enable or toggle features or settings in the baserom, or activate a simple UberASM.</p>
<table border="1" class="full">

</table>
<small>Earlier versions of the baserom may have fewer objects.</small>
<h4 id="retry-objects">Retry System Settings</h4>
<p>Inserting these objects into your level to override the default settings of the retry system or even change the retry settings between sublevels.</p>

<tr><td>B0</td><td>Instant Retry</td><td>Make the retry skip using prompt and restart instantly after dying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>B1</td><td>Prompt Retry</td><td>Set the retry system to use a prompt that says "Retry" in the middle of the screen.</td></tr>

<tr><td>B3</td><td>No Power Ups from Midways</td><td>Disable gaining a power-up (mushroom) from a midway point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>B4</td><td>Vanilla Retry</td><td>Set the retry system back to using Vanilla death routine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>B6</td><td>Enable Retry Indicator</td><td>Display <a href="./Features.html#retry-indicator">an indicator</a> in the HUD when a level using fast retry.</td></tr>
</table>
<small>Retry indicator only in version 5.7 or later of the baserom.</small>
<h4 id="player-state the level ">Initial Player States</h4>
<p>You can use these objects to start the player in various states when they enter the level at any point.</p>
<table border="1" class="full">
<tr><th>ID</th><th>Object</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>C0</td><td>Start with a Mushroom</td><td>Have the player start the level with a Mushroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>C1</td><td>Start with Cape</td><td>Have the player start the level with a Cape.</td></tr>

<tr><td>C7</td><td>Start on Red Yoshi</td><td>Have the player start the level on a Red Yoshi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>C8</td><td>Start in Spin Jump State</td><td>Have the player start the level spinning (most useful when Mario is in the air).</td></tr>
</table>
<small>These objects are in version 5.7 or later of the baserom.</small>
<p>Due to how the memory works for the power-up or Yoshi states <i>you can only have one of each of those objects active at a time</i>, you can't have Cape and Flower or two Yoshi objects.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="inserting-objects">Inserting Custom Objects</h3>
<p>To insert a custom UberASM object, make note of the custom ID value from the tables above.</p>
<p>Next, open the "Add Object Manual (hex)" window while in Lunar Magic's "Layer 1 editing" mode, either from the "Edit &rarr; Insert manual..." menu action, or by pressing the <span class="key">Insert</span> key in this mode.</p>
<p>In the window that appears, type the ID value for the UberASM Object of your choice into the "Size/Type/Ext" field, leaving the other fields at zero (0), and press OK to insert.</p>
<center><img src="img/insert_object_manual.png" alt="Lunar Magic's Add Object Manual (hex) Window" title="Lunar Magic's Add Object Manual (hex) Window"></center>
<p>Multiple custom extended objects can be inserted by repeating the steps above for each UberASM object.</p>
<h4>Appearance in Lunar Magic</h4>
<p>When inserted, custom extended objects will look like a pair of garbage tiles in Lunar Magic, but these objects won't actually appear in game.</p>
<center><img src="img/garbled_extension_objects.png" alt="Garbled Custom object tiles in Lunar Magic" title="Garbled Custom object tiles in Lunar Magic"></center>
<p>An object may occasionally use an exit-enabled (door) tile which may display a warning depending on your Lunar Magic settings (the included objects avoid this by skipping some IDs).</p>
