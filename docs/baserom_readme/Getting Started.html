<h3 id="clean-rom">Provide a Clean Super Mario World ROM</h2>
<p>First things first, you'll need to provide a copy of a clean, headered<sup>1</sup> Super Mario World ROM (USA version) renamed to <code>clean.smc</code> and placed in the "resources" folder so it can be found by the build tool. Take care to ensure the file extension* is <code>.smc</code> and not <code>.sfc</code>.</p>
<p class="infobox">It is important to do this step otherwise you can't get started.</p>
<small>*this may require you to turn on extensions in Windows' File Explorer.</small>
<p><sup>1</sup>If your rom does not have a header&ndash;which you will notice because tools will be unable to work with it&ndash;open it in Lunar Magic and you will be prompted to add a header. Hit "OK" after being prompted but <b>DO NOT SAVE</b> the rom.</p>

<h3 id="initialize-the-baserom">Initialize the Baserom</h3>
<p>To start using the baserom you will first have to initialize the project as it comes without any of the tools bundled. You can do this by running the provided script: <code>!initialize_baserom.bat</code>. In Windows, this can be done by double clicking on it in File Explorer, or executing it from a Terminal or the Command Line.</p>
<p>The script will launch a new command line window where you will see the following menu.</p>

</pre>
<p><b>Both step 1 and 2 are required</b> to make sure things are all good to go.</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>"1. Download and setup all baserom tools"<br>This step will check if the tools required by the baserom are setup, and if not it will download them.</p>.</li>
    <li><p>"2. Run first build of the Baserom"<br>This step will build the baserom from scratch using Callisto so you can get right to hacking on your project. </p>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="infobox">If the first build fails, run Callisto manually from the <span class="dir">buildtool</span> folder so you can see what went wrong.</p>
<p>To learn the details of the initialization process is you can read the <a href="Initialization.html">Baserom Initialization</a> documentation.</

<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h3>
<p>If everything has been set-up correctly, with all tools set-up and the first build was successfull, the baserom is ready for use!</p>
<p>You can jump right into working on your project by running "callisto.exe" from the <span class="dir">buildtool</span> folder and select "Edit" to launch Lunar Magic. From Lunar Magic you can access much of your project with the custom <a href="./User Toolbar.html">User Toolbar</a>.</p>
<p class="infobox"><b>Important:</b> don't run the baserom's tool's individually. Use Callisto to make all changes your project.</p>
