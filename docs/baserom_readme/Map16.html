<h3>Point of Advice</h3>
<p>You should use Lunar Magic's "Add Objects" window as much as possible to construct your levels instead of placing tiles directly from map 16. Objects that are composed of several tiles take up fewer bytes in-ROM when placed in levels.</p><p>When you use Direct Map 16 (i.e. placing tiles directly in your level from the 16x16 editor), each tile placed in a level counts as its own object in the level and this can dramatically increase the bytesize of levels if there are many many tiles.</p>

<h4>Page 05</h4>
<p>An optional page of extra vanilla tiles, some of which are graphics header dependent, that isn't inserted into the baserom. A map 16 file to import can be found in <span class="dir">resources/map 16</span>.</p>

<h4>Pages 40,41</h4>
<p>Tiles for all the in-level text seen in the <a href="./Levels.html#info-level">Info Level</a>. These pages can safely be deleted from your ROM if you delete that level from your project.</p>
<h4>Page 50</h4>
<p>Tiles for ExGraphic big bush and big pipe tiles. A map 16 file to import these tiles can be found in <span class="dir">resources/map 16</span>.</p>
